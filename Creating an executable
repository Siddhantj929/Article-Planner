I used PyInstaller to create the executable.

Since the PyInstaller is not fully customised for Python 3.6 yet, there needs to be one hook-file added to the module.

1. Locate PyInstaller folder..\hooks, e.g. C:\Program Files\Python\Lib\site-packages\PyInstaller\hooks.

2. Create file hook-pandas.py with contents: hiddenimports = ['pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas']
         
3. Save it and delete .spec file, build and dist folders just to be sure.

4. Then run the command on terminal/cmd : py -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --noupx 'Article Planner.py'

Note: I wasn't able to upload the .exe file due to some issues. That's why I added these instructions here!
