*This a **non-commercial** application made for **educational purposes only.***

## Introduction
I made this application with the needs of Bloggers/Webmasters in mind.
But *anyone* who deals with a **LOT** of text files or MS Word documents will find this software useful!

Since we have to manage a lot of articles everyday, it can be tedious to handle all of them on our own.

This application provides a better, cleaner way to manage all your completed/incomplete articles, and **much** more.

## Development Details
This software is made with Python 3.6 using PyQt5 modules and Qt Creator for the GUI of the program.

The .ui form is converted to .py script usinf pyuic5 provided in the PyQt5.

The executable file can be found in the "dist" folder and currently only runs on windows. 
Users of different operating systems can convert the .py script to executables using PyInstaller.
